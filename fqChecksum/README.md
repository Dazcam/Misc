I'm currently running into a problem where I need to compare/contrast fastq files generated by multiple demultiplexing pipelines. In particular, given any 2 fastq files I would like to know:

1. The total number of identical entries
2. A list of entries unique to each file (note that a single difference in a read between two files counts for this).

Ideally, I'd like to be able to set a read size, such that reads can be subset. This script aims to allow doing all of this.
